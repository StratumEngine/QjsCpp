# QJS CPP
A C++ wrapper for QuickJS.

It's roughly based off of https://github.com/ftk/quickjspp

It's designed to use as little exceptions as possible, because I like it better that way.

It's a header-only library, so you can just stick the contents of the `include/` directory in your project, and it'll work.

I've tested it with Clang 18 and GCC 14. I don't know if it'll work with other compilers. I'm open to pull requests to add support for other compilers.
